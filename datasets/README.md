# TEDLIUM_release2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Due to GitHub upload limitation, please download full datasets at 
[TED-LIUM Corpus](http://www-lium.univ-lemans.fr/en/content/ted-lium-corpus)

In this folder, we only upload some example datasets. To generate more datasets, 
you need first download TEDLIUM_release2 and run the jupyter notebook 
**processing_audio.ipynb** to convert into .wav file. Next, use the method showed
on the project website to generate more noise samples.
